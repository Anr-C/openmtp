            <strong>OpenMTP</strong> was a project that I started to solve a
            problem that was so personal to me. But I always knew, that
            there&apos;s a community, whose facing the same problem as I did.

            I wasn&apos;t wrong, I guess. Within a few months of launch, we are
            a strong community with users from over&nbsp;
            <strong>70 countries</strong>. It&apos;s overwhelming to see the
            response that I have received from all of you, not just appreciating
            the app, but also giving me suggestions and feedback to improve it.

            I read each and every message that you send and am constantly

            Some of you have been telling me that there are issues with
            connecting certain mobile phones (<i>mostly Samsung</i>) to OpenMTP.
            I have been working hard to fix this issue by migrating the existing
            MTP Kernel to a better one but the development has slowed down due
            to various reasons.

            I am looking for developers who can write Native Node.js modules and
